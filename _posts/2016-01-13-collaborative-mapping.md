Save the date!

We're gonna follow up on our Anatomy of a Webmap & leaflet.js tutorials and build an awesome, collaborative map... a great excuse to learn more about git, GitHub, and GeoJSON. This project uses git for version control, GitHub to house the data, and provides editing examples using [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/), a great tool for editing GeoJSON files. 

This will be a gentle introduction to GitHub for beginners (no command line today, folks) I'm excited to try out this collaboration technique for building small crowd-sourced geographic datasets and displaying them with our newly acquired leaflet skills! If you missed the last meetup, no fear. We'll catch ya right up! 

Bring a laptop if you can, and go ahead and [setup a github account](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one.

As always, we'll continue our show & tell of interesting projects and blogs. If you have any links you'd like to share send them to maptimenola@gmail.com or tweet them at [@maptimenola](https://twitter.com/maptimenola) (or remember them). 

Pizza and geo-gossip @ 6pm  
tutorial @ 7pm

P.S. we're looking for more skill-share presenters! If you've got some map-related skills you're excited to share let us know and we can get ya up on the calendar.
