title: Maptime&#58; Making Sense of the RTAs Data

Hi all. It's that time again: Maptime! This month we'll be taking a look at the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority ([RTA](http://www.norta.com/Home.aspx))'s data. [Benjamin Eckel](https://github.com/bhelx) has been doing a bit of work with the geo-data and will be sharing tips and tricks on what he's learned. He'll lead a discussion on how to get access to the data (which is harder than you'd think) and how to use & understand the underlying data.

As always, during geo-gossip we'll continue our show & tell of interesting projects, news, and resources. If you have any links you'd like to share send them to maptimenola@gmail.com or tweet them at [@maptimenola](https://twitter.com/maptimeNOLA) (or remember them).  

Schedule: 

Pizza and geo-gossip @ 6pm 

Discussion @ 7pm 

(Lock-up @ 9pm)

PSA: There will be a general discussion on ways MaptimeNOLA members can participate in the [National Day of Civic Hacking](https://www.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-2016) on June 4th so stick around if youâ€™re interested!
