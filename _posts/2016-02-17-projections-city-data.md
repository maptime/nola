We hope you thoroughly enjoyed Carnival! Note: we pushed back the meetup a week due to Ash Wednesday. Our meetup is normally 2nd Wednesdays of the month.

Schedule: 
Pizza and geo-gossip @ 6pm   
Discussion & tutorial @ 7pm  
(Lock-up @ 9pm)

As always, during geo-gossip we'll continue our show & tell of interesting projects, news, and resources. If you have any links you'd like to share send them to maptimenola@gmail.com or tweet them at [@maptimenola](https://twitter.com/maptimenola) (or remember them).  

After geo-gossip, we'll be hosting a discussion & lab on projections, datums, and accessing public data from the City of New Orleans's [data portal](https://data.nola.gov/) and using it in community mapping tools. 

If you've ever tried this before, you might have found it a little intimidating with different file types and projections associated with each data set. Marc will lead us through a tutorial and share his experiences making it work. 

If you're interested in civic hacking or working with the city's public data get on this. Bring your questions! One of us might know how to trouble shoot it, and if not, we'll be putting together a list of questions for the City.

Many thanks to [Boundless](http://boundlessgeo.com/) for sponsoring our Pizza this week and to maptime member Marc Cenac for leading this month's discussion.
