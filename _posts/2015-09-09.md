Hey guys, it's about time for our third maptime! 

Join us next Wednesday at LaunchPad as Matt shares what he knows about OpenStreetMap, a collaborative project to make a free editable map of the world. For those interested in getting some hands-on experience, bring a laptop and we'll be happy to get you set up to do your first (or next) OSM edit.  

After the presentation, we'll be troubleshooting as a group how to find and upload local 3D building data to OSMbuildings. That's right. 3D Data. We'll try to add heights for buildings in the CBD or French Quarter and then when we're done, boom, we'll have our own pretty 3D map. If you've got any good ideas for a source of building height data bring 'em! 

As always, we'll continue our show & tell of interesting projects and blogs. If you have any links you'd like to share send them to maptimenola@gmail.com or tweet them at @maptimenola (or remember them).  

See you soon! Pizza @ 6, tutorial @ 7.

P.S. we're looking for more skill-share presenters! If you've got some map-related skills you're excited to share let us know and we can get ya up on the calendar.
