Join us Wednesday for our second maptime! We'll continue our show & tell of interesting projects and blogs while we dive into an introductory tutorial on the anatomy of a web map. If you have any links you'd like to share send them to maptimenola@gmail.com or tweet them at @maptimenola (or remember them)

For those interested in getting some hands-on experience, bring a laptop and we can introduce you to a few free web mapping platforms. As always, feel free to bring your own dataset to work with or we can troubleshoot as a group how to get some of those open nola.gov data sets up and visualized on a web map.

Pizza arrives at 6pm, tutorials begin at 7. See you there!
