title: A Brief Introduction to Geographic Data Formats & A Crash Course in Carto...(DB)
rsvp: https://www.meetup.com/MaptimeNOLA/events/233759256/
---
We missed you in August, so we're brining you a two-fer September! Bring a machine if you've got it - we'll be making a map or two. 

We'll start with a basic overview of a few data formats you might've heard buzzing around (shapefile, kml, wfs, geojson, geotiff). If you've got favorite tricks or tools for file transformations now's your time to shine.

This overview will be followed by a surprisingly productive crash course on visualizing and styling geographic data using Carto.com lead by Emily Ashley. If we're lucky and you're down, we may even get to touch on using SQL (structured query language) in-browser to filter and analyze spatial data in Carto. How cool is that? So please bring a laptop if you'd like to follow along (recommended!) We'll have example data sets to work with, but feel free to bring any that are of interest to you and we can probably make it work :)

Schedule:  

Pizza and geo-gossip* @ 6pm

Discussion & tutorial @ 7pm

(Lock-up @ 9pm)

*geo-gossip is maptimeNOLA's version of show & tell + lightning talks. The floor & projector are open for the first hour of the meetup to share interesting projects, struggles, blogs, news, or mappy stuff you recently learned you think we'd like to learn, too. 

If you have any links you'd like to share with us before you forget send them to maptimenola@gmail.com or tweet them at @maptimenola (or remember them).
