This time we're hands on - it's a full on hack night. We'll review some previous presentations (anatomy of a web map, leaflet basics) and partner up. 

Bring a computer and by the end of the session you'll have published a map. On the internet. With all the tricks we've been learning. Hooray!

Tools we'll be using:


+	github & github pages 
+	html & css 
+	leaflet.js 

Beginners welcome.  


As always, we'll continue our show & tell of interesting projects and blogs. If you have any links you'd like to share send them to maptimenola@gmail.com or tweet them to [@maptimenola](https://twitter.com/maptimenola) (or remember them). 

See you soon! Pizza @ 6, tutorial @ 7. 

Let's make some maps!
