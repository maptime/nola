Please mind the location re-shift - we are returning to LaunchPad! 

Maptime is happy to welcome Ezra Boyd from Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation and Scott Eustis from the Gulf Restoration Network. We'll be hearing about the Multiple Lines of Defense and the Coastal Master Plan (which is a set of geospatial computational models to evaluate restoration and flood protection projects) and other exciting projects from both the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation and Gulf Restoration Network. Join in as we learn more about how we can protect and restore the natural resources of the Gulf Region. 

As always, during geo-gossip we'll continue our show & tell of interesting projects, news, and resources. If you have any links you'd like to share send them to maptimenola gmail or tweet them at @maptimenola (or remember them).  

Schedule: 

Pizza and geo-gossip @ 6pm 

Discussion & tutorial @ 7pm 

(Lock-up @ 9pm)
