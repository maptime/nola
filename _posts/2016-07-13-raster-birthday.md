title: Raster Fun and MaptimeNOLA Turns One!

Can you believe it's been a year, already? 

Join us Wednesday for #maptime as Chris Sliwinski leads a discussion on using rasters to perform spatial analysis. Over the past year, we've covered a lot about vector data (geometries like points, lines, polygons) but what if we want to display area information that cannot easily be divided into vector features? Well, we (and plenty of mappers before us) have got ya covered.

A raster, in it's simplest form, consists of a matrix of cells or pixels organized into a grid each containing a value that represents the conditions for the area covered by that cell - like digital aerial photographs, imagery from satellites, digital pictures, or even scanned maps. They're super cool and useful. We'll check out some terrain data and *fingers crossed* perhaps Chris will lead us in a live demo using rasters for spatial analysis in flood studies. I'm excited to see what he's got to share!

After the presentation, we'll take a moment to eat cake, check out our year-in-review, and chat about what you'd like to hear and share with maptimeNOLA over the next year. 

Schedule:  

Pizza and geo-gossip @ 6pm  

Discussion & tutorial @ 7pm  

(Lock-up @ 9pm)

Did I mention there will be cake?
