title: Maptime&#58; Open Mic Night

It's an Open Mic Night. We're going unrehearsed, off-the-cuff, unplugged. However you wanna say it: Tonight, the stage is ours! 

... and by stage I mean projector :) 

It's a very unstructured Maptime and we're here to fulfill your mappiest-heart's desires. We wanna see what you've been working on. What makes you click? What did you learn this week?  What did you get stuck on? What's on your Round-To-It list? What blew your mind? Does someone in this room know something you're itching to understand? Let's find out. 

We think it's about time to take that back-burner project off of simmer. So tonight is the night to show off some of your skills, ask a buddy to show off theirs, or make a friend with the same jams. We'll have a bucket of topics/questions to contribute to/answer from, two screens available, and pizza for the masses. Feel free to bring a bottle of wine or beer :)

Pizza arrives  @ 6pm. Lock-up @ 9pm.

See you there!
