Huzzah! You asked, we arranged. On Oct 14th MaptimeNOLA will take it's first look at [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. 

I'm very pleased to have Darin Acosta joining us to share some of his experience in developing the New Orleans Short Term [Rental Report](http://nolarentalreport.com/#/). We'll get to see the process of how the data flows from Airbnb and HomeAway and onto the front-end map interface with Leaflet. 

He'll also share a little bit about a project he's been working on [German Coast] (http://germancoast.verylongroad.com/) that explores Leaflet as a story telling device with dynamic map events. He's done some great work. Check out his [portfolio](http://darinacosta.com/) to see what he can do (so we can ask him more questions!!)

As always, we'll continue our show & tell of interesting projects and blogs. If you have any links you'd like to share send them to maptimenola@gmail.com or tweet them at [@maptimenola](https://twitter.com/maptimenola) (or remember them). 

See you soon! Pizza @ 6, tutorial @ 7. 

P.S. we're looking for more skill-share presenters! If you've got some map-related skills you're excited to share let us know and we can get ya up on the calendar.
